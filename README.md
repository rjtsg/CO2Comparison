# CO2Comparison
Look at the CO2 emissions for different ways of transport

This project will investigate how much CO2 different ways of transport costs. 
This way it will be clear if there is an turning point in chosing which transport you should chose when you are travelling an x distance.
It will also look what is the avarage distance travelled by each kind of transport.
As an addition it will be investigated how much CO2 trees can absorb, so that it can be calculated how many trees should be planted to be CO2 neutral.
